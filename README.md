30 days machine learning challange.

## Prerequisite Skills

- Algebra
  - variables, coefficients, and functions
  - linear equations such as 
  - logarithms, and logarithmic equations such as 
  - sigmoid function
- Linear algebra
  - tensor and tensor rank
  - matrix multiplication
- Trigonometry
  - tanh
